            I remember always having this desire to go against the grain.<br>
            And that feeling has never left me. I don't think it ever leaves those who are blessed with it.<br>
            here we call it the "IDGAF" attitude. Some have it more than others, but it doesn't matter, because it's inside all of us. Unleash it.
